        Who am I as in who I really am or who am I as in what I do?
        </p>
        <p>
        Since actually telling you who I am is a lot more difficult than just telling you what I do, I’ll just go ahead and assume that you’d like to know what I do and not who I am in a deep philosophical sense.

        I am a software developer, primarily. I spent most of my time on the frontend when I started software development—like most software developers—but I’ve begun to transition to the backend because I’ve found that I’m a lot better at handling  business logic than I am at thinking about user interfaces.

        Since the Meta Frontend Developer professional certificate I took had a course titled “Principles of UX Design,” I also know a thing or two about UI/UX design. I hope I adhered to those principles in the design of this website.

        As is expected of me, I’ll attempt to make what I do sound grandly inspirational: in my case, it is that I turn great ideas into awesome products; you just give me the chance to prove it to you.

        Stay tuned, because what starts here might just go on to change the world.
